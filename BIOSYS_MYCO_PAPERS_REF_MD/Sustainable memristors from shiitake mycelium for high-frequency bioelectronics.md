Abstract

Neuromorphic computing, inspired by the structure of the brain, offers advantages in

parallel processing, memory storage, and energy efficiency. However, current

semiconductor-based neuromorphic chips require rare-earth materials and costly fab-

rication processes, whereas neural organoids need complex bioreactor maintenance.
In this study, we explored shiitake (Lentinula edodes) fungi as a robust, sustainable
alternative, exploiting its adaptive electrical signaling, which is akin to neuronal spik-

ing. We demonstrate fungal computing via mycelial networks interfaced with elec-

trodes, showing that fungal memristors can be grown, trained, and preserved through

dehydration, retaining functionality at frequencies up to 5.85 kHz, with an accuracy

of 90 ± 1%. Notably, shiitake has exhibited radiation resistance, suggesting its viabil-

ity for aerospace applications. Our findings show that fungal computers can provide

scalable, eco-friendly platforms for neuromorphic tasks, bridging bioelectronics and

unconventional computing.

Background

Overview

The development of neuromorphic hardware relies on memristive devices capable
of emulating synaptic behavior, with potential applications in energy-efficient com-
puting and artificial intelligence1. Recent work has explored natural, biodegradable
substrates as sustainable alternatives to conventional inorganic memristors [1].
In this study, we investigated the potential of the edible fungus Lentinula edodes
(shiitake mushroom) as a platform for memristor fabrication. By examining the elec-
trical response of mushroom-derived materials under repeated voltage cycling, we
explored stable memristive switching behavior, retention, and endurance.
Shiitake-based devices not only demonstrate reproducible memory effects, but also

Memristors

Memristor devices offer substantial advantages in robotic, industrial, and transport
applications due to their unique electrical properties and ability to mimic neural
functions. They can enhance various control systems, facilitate efficient information
processing, and ultimately improve the overall performance of autonomous systems.
One of the key strengths of memristors is their capacity for efficient and self-

adaptive in situ learning, which is critical for applications in robotics and autonomous
vehicles. In memristor-based neural networks, the devices can adjust their resistance
based on previous inputs, allowing for a form of analog learning that closely resem-
bles the synaptic behavior in biological systems [1]. This capability enables robots
and autonomous vehicles to learn from their environment and adapt in real time,
enhancing their ability to navigate complex situations effectively. It has been found
that such systems can achieve low-latency responses, which are essential for high-
speed decision-making in dynamic environments [2].

Memristors also have the advantage of integrating memory and processing capabilities
into a single device, enabling a simplified architecture for autonomous control systems [3].
For instance, in autonomous vehicles, trajectory-tracking and path-following tasks can be
performed using memristor-based controllers that allow for rapid calculations and real-time
adjustments to control variables [4]. This integration, especially with parallelization, helps to
address the challenges posed by separate memory and processing units, which can lead
to delays and increased power consumption in traditional control systems [4].

Additionally, the resilience of memristor devices against environmental changes,
and their ability to operate under varying conditions, make them particularly suitable
for autonomous applications, such as spacecraft electronics or vehicles operating
in unpredictable road environments [4]. This is complemented by the precision in
control that memristor-based systems can offer, which is significant for maintaining
stability and performance while following desired trajectories [5].

Moreover, the low power consumption of memristors is particularly beneficial in
robotics and autonomous vehicles, where energy efficiency is paramount. Hybrid
analog–digital memristor systems can minimize power usage during processing
without sacrificing responsiveness, which can prolong operational times by reducing
the frequency at which recharging or battery replacement is required, enhancing the
feasibility of deploying such systems in mobile applications [2].

Ultimately, the potential of memristors to emulate human-like decision-making and

learning processes could be exploited to endow robotic systems and autonomous
vehicles with functionalities not found in conventional control systems. The ability of
memristors to perform complex computations efficiently, learn adaptively, and inte-
grate both memory and processing into a unified approach make them a cornerstone
technology for the future development of intelligent autonomous systems. However,
the production of memristors often requires rare-earth minerals and expensive semi-
conductor foundries.

Fungal electronics

Fungi possess innate abilities to adapt to various environmental conditions and efficiently process information through
their interconnected network of hyphae. These characteristics make fungi an ideal candidate for developing sustainable
computing systems from. Our aim was to design and implement a novel fungal memristor-based computing architecture
that could significantly reduce energy consumption and minimize electronic waste. We approached this using substantially
simpler bioreactors and nutrient cultures than those required for conventional neurons and neural organoids. The unique
advantages of fungal memristors stem from the biological properties of fungal materials, which distinguish them from typi-
cal inorganic or polymer alternatives [6,7].

First, one of the main benefits of fungal memristors is their environmentally sustainable and biodegradable nature. Conven-
tional memristors often contain transition metal oxides or silicon-based structures, the production or disposal of which can pose
environmental challenges [6,7]. By contrast, fungal materials are derived from organic biomass, making them both sustainable
and significantly less harmful to the environment. This aligns with increasing efforts toward developing greener electronic mate-
rials, as highlighted in previous work emphasizing the importance of sustainability in technology development [8].

Second, fungal memristors exhibit remarkable adaptability in their electrical properties. The structural composition of
fungal materials often allows for a range of conductive pathways that can form dynamically under the influence of elec-
trical stimuli, similar to the conductive filaments formed in conventional memristors [9,10]. This adaptability can lead to
enhanced performance in neuromorphic applications through the facilitation of variable resistance states that mimic syn-
aptic behaviors more closely than traditional memristive materials, which often have static crystalline structures that can
lead to variability problems or performance limitations at the nanoscale [11].

Furthermore, fungal memristors may consume less power than traditional materials due to their unique electrochemical
properties. It has been claimed that some organic materials, including those derived from fungi, can operate effectively at lower
voltages while maintaining stable switching characteristics––a trait that is crucial for developing energy-efficient devices for
portable electronics and Internet of Things applications [12]. This can significantly extend battery life and reduce energy costs in
processing and memory applications, which have become focal points in the research into neuromorphic systems [13].

Finally, the natural composition and multicellularity of fungal materials can lead to more naturalistic models for neural
networks. Because these materials are subject to biological processes, they may inherently incorporate characteristics
that resemble biological neuronal networks, including plasticity and memory capabilities that could evolve with usage. This
biological mimicry could strengthen the development of more advanced artificial neural networks, enabling applications
such as adaptive learning systems and intelligent sensor networks [14].

Fungus types

The potential use of common food mushrooms, such as shiitake and button mushrooms (Agaricus bisporus), as organic
memristors is an emerging area of research that exploits the unique properties of these fungi [6,7,13]. Memristors, which
are non-volatile memory devices that retain information even without power, can benefit from the porous structures and
electrical properties of the organic materials derived from mushrooms.

Shiitake mushrooms have been shown to possess a hierarchically porous carbon structure when activated. This porous

structure can enhance the electrochemical performance of devices, making them suitable candidates for use in energy
storage systems, including supercapacitors and, potentially, memristors [15]. Highly conductive carbon materials have
been created from shiitake, suggesting that these materials could be engineered to exhibit memristive behavior [16].
Shiitake-derived carbon is a sustainable alternative to traditional materials and can enhance the performance of electronic
devices due to its unique structural properties.

Button mushrooms have also shown significant potential in this context. Research has indicated that their porosity can

be exploited to create materials with large surface areas, which are essential for the development of efficient electronic
components [17]. The synthesis of carbon composites from button mushrooms has been explored, revealing their ability

PLOS One | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0328965  October 10, 2025

to function effectively in energy storage applications [17]. Furthermore, the integration of button mushrooms into electronic
systems has been investigated, demonstrating their potential as substrates for electronic devices [18].

In addition to their structural properties, the unique biological characteristics of fungi, including their ability to interact

with various chemical compounds, can be harnessed to develop novel sensing technologies. For instance, electronic
noses have been developed that use mushroom extracts to detect volatile compounds. These could be adapted for use
in electronic devices that require environmental-sensing capabilities [19,20]. This intersection of biology and electronics
opens new avenues for creating multifunctional devices that incorporate the sensory capabilities of mushrooms.

Radiation, resistance, and resilience

The radiation resistance of shiitake mushrooms has been studied primarily in terms of their ability to withstand and possibly
derive benefits from exposure to ionizing radiation. This resistance can be attributed to several biochemical and physiolog-
ical attributes. A possible factor is lentinan, a polysaccharide found in the cell walls of shiitake. Lentinan provides structural
integrity and exhibits immunomodulatory effects that may enhance the mushroom’s ability to respond to environmental
stresses, including radiation exposure. Although some research has suggested that lentinan possesses properties that may
help mitigate oxidative stress [21], there have been limited studies directly linking lentinan to radiation resistance in shiitake
mushrooms.

Shiitake mushrooms have also shown a notable ability to adapt to their environmental conditions, including variable

radiation levels. Studies involving fungi in space research have indicated that certain taxa can enhance their survival
through morphological changes or increased melanin production in response to radiation [22]. This radiation resistance
implies a suitability of fungal electronics for aerospace applications, where cosmic rays and ambient radiation can interfere
with conventional electronics. Fungi’s physical flexibility and low energy requirements would also be advantageous rela-
tive to conventional solutions [18,19]. These studies have not specifically addressed shiitake, but the general adaptability
observed in fungi suggests that this species could respond similarly to such conditions.

Another example of the resilience of shiitake mushrooms is their ability to maintain their nutritional and bioactive quali-
ties after irradiation. For example, they retain essential nutrients and bioactive compounds even after exposure to ultravi-
olet radiation [23]. The high content of ergosterol, a precursor to vitamin D, found in shiitake mushrooms, reinforces their
potential for beneficial outcomes following exposure to radiation because this compound can be converted into vitamin D2
when subjected to ultraviolet light [24].

Lastly, shiitake mushrooms could be considered in the development of dietary supplements or functional foods that

could serve a broader purpose in radioprotection. Their multirole efficacy as a food source and electrical component
emphasizes a sustainable approach to utilizing biological entities that can withstand environmental stresses, including
radiation. This is especially relevant in aerospace and exploration contexts, where promoting health in astronauts could
reduce the risks associated with their increased radiation exposure during missions [22]. Also, shiitake mushrooms can
withstand environmental stresses, including radiation, while remaining safe for human consumption.

In summary, the radiation resistance of shiitake mushrooms is linked to the presence of protective compounds, such as

lentinan, and their ability to adapt morphologically. These factors have contributed to our understanding of their survival
strategies and are suggestive of potential applications in areas where radiation exposure is a significant concern, such as
aerospace and radiation sensing. By culturing and evaluating the memristive properties of shiitake mushrooms, we can
determine their suitability for use as sustainable, low-cost bioelectronics.

Methods

Summary

Testing the memristive behavior of shiitake mycelium involved several steps, the first being culturing the fungi, and then
preparing the samples by drying and rehydrating them. Following this, the most successfully cultivated samples were

electrically characterized using a test circuit. Additionally, a special circuit was constructed for further evaluating the feasi-
bility of using mycelium for violate memory.

Hyphal cultivation

Due to the financial and environmental constraints of this project, all four evaluated memristors fabricated for our exper-
iments were composed exclusively of low-cost, organic materials. Based on previous research, we identified materials
such as biocompatible composites [25,26] as viable candidates for device construction and programming due to their
biodegradability and compatibility with fungal growth.

The initial phase of experimentation focused on the cultivation of fungal hyphae in the selected organic growth media.

Nine samples were prepared in standard polycarbonate Petri dishes. The growth conditions were carefully maintained
to promote optimal fungal development, with a controlled temperature range of 20–22°C, a relative humidity of 70%, and
mixed light exposure to replicate natural terrestrial conditions. The nutrient substrate consisted of a mixture of farro seed,
wheat germ, and hay, selected for their organic compositions and ability to support robust fungal growth. Each sample
was inoculated with spores or mycelial plugs of shiitake.

The samples (e.g., see Fig 1) were observed and documented biweekly to track their growth consistency and mor-
phological development. Observations including hyphal density, surface coverage, and color changes were recorded in a
structured laboratory logbook. In addition to these visual inspections, a brief scratch test was performed to track the prog-
ress of the mycelium throughout the substrate. The log included timestamps and qualitative notes, enabling consistent
comparison across samples and time points.

Drying and rehydration process

Once full hyphal coverage and structural maturation were achieved (i.e., when the Petri dish was covered), the samples
were transitioned to the drying phase. The Petri dishes were left in a well-ventilated area under direct sunlight at room
temperature for approximately seven days to ensure uniform dehydration. The samples were rotated periodically to avoid
uneven hardening. As previously reported, this process transformed the fungal matrix into a rigid, disk-like structure while
retaining its overall shape and connectivity [26,27].

Prior to testing, the samples were rehydrated using a fine mist of aerosolized deionized water. The rehydration was con-
ducted using a standard commercial spray bottle, held within a distance of 10 cm from each sample. This brief rehydration step
restored the required level of conductivity without introducing bulk moisture that could have altered their mechanical integrity.

Electrical characterization

Electrical testing protocols were designed based on theoretical memristors [6,7]. An alternating current was applied to
each sample, and the corresponding current–voltage (I–V) characteristics were measured using a digital oscilloscope. As
established in previous works, the test setup used a voltage divider to model multiple memristors in the same circuit [6,7].
To extract accurate current values, a known shunt resistor was placed in series with each sample. As shown in Fig 2,
voltage readings were captured across both the sample and the resistor, with Channel 1 of the oscilloscope measuring the
input voltage and Channel 2 capturing the voltage drop across the shunt resistor. The current values were then calculated
using Kirchhoff’s current law, allowing derivation of the I–V characteristics from the voltage differentials. All waveform data
were exported in comma-separated values (CSV) format for subsequent digital analysis and visualization.

To thoroughly investigate the memristive behavior of the four samples using mycelium coverage density, voltage

sweeps were conducted using both square and sinusoidal waveforms. The square waves were employed to detect sharp
threshold-based resistance changes, whereas the sinusoidal inputs provided insights into the more subtle, continuous
mem-fractive behaviors. This dual approach enabled the identification of hysteresis loops in the I–V curves––a key signa-
ture of memristor functionality.

A square wave was used first, with the peak-to-peak voltage starting at 200 mVpp and increasing. If a sinusoidal wave
form exhibited more promising results, a broader range of frequencies was explored. The frequencies and voltages used
in the initial tests for memristive properties are detailed in Table 1.

Accuracy and error were calculated based on how many reads agreed with the analog threshold, the number of mal-

formed readings, timing jitter, recording instability, and port delays [28].

The accuracy was calculated using Equation 1, where accuracy is a percentage converted from product of correct sam-

ples C over the total number of samples N. The standard error SE was calculated for each case, as shown in Equation 2.

Volatile memory testing

In the event that the fungal samples exhibited memristive behavior, a specialized electronic circuit was designed and
implemented to investigate the volatile memory characteristics of two fungal samples in series. The test circuit was a volt-
age divider with memory. The test involved setting an arbitrary analog voltage value to represent a high value, and below
that threshold was a low value. The frequency range started at 200 Hz and concluded at 5.85 kHz. Similarly to previous
work, Fig 3 shows the configuration and layout of this testing circuit [6].

Comparably to previous work in memristive computing, the volatile memory circuit employed an Arduino UNO micro-

controller development board and a voltage divider consisting of two memristive elements [6,7]. Given the polarized
nature of memristors, the circuit was designed to allow a voltage of opposite polarity to that used during read operations to
be set. Both voltages used were approximately 5 V. The Arduino UNO cyclically applied a high signal to a relay containing
a half-rectified sine wave through one of its digital output pins when reading the memristor bridge, thereby charging the
divider. This process induced an asymmetry in resistance, with the memristor closest to the input experiencing a reduction
in resistance, while the output-side memristor exhibited an increase. The voltage across the divider was subsequently
read using an analog input pin, and another digital pin was used to run 5 V across the divider. The Arduino interpreted
the stored state as “on” only when the measured voltage exceeded a predefined threshold, effectively enabling volatile
memory detection based on the transient resistance states of the memristors. Ten tests were repeated on each of the four
samples. The physical implementation of this circuit is shown in Fig 4.

The memristor voltage divider was tested by applying a 5 Vpp sinusoidal signal to the memristors for approximately
0.01–0.1 ms. This signal was delivered via a relay triggered by digital pin 6 of the Arduino UNO. Following this brief stim-
ulation period, the sinusoidal input was disabled, and digital pin 5 was activated to initiate the read phase. Analog voltage
measurements were then acquired through the A1 analog input pin. To minimize the effects of floating voltages, a 1 MΩ

pull-down resistor was connected to this pin. Voltage readings were recorded for approximately 0.1–0.10 ms before the
cycle repeated, allowing for rapid and continuous testing of the memristive behavior.

The measurements were transmitted over a serial communication interface at a baud rate of 57,600 and were cap-
tured as raw text files for analysis. The data were post-processed and visualized using a custom Python script based
on the matplotlib library, enabling clear identification of memory retention patterns and resistance state changes across
successive cycles.

Hypothesis

The general testing setup, based on that used in the literature, is able to indicate memristive behavior in fungal samples.
If present, this behavior would manifest as a characteristic pinched hysteresis loop in the I–V curves, typically intersecting
at or near the origin––a well-established signature of memristive systems [6,7]. We hypothesized that such a response

PLOS One | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0328965  October 10, 2025

would emerge under specific combinations of voltage amplitude and input frequency. Where memristive behavior was
indicated, volatile memory tests were conducted.

Results

Overview

The fungal memristors were tested across a range of voltages, waveforms, and frequencies. Below, we first detail the test
inputs used to explore the memristive properties and generate I–V curves. Then we present the voltage and frequency
(graphical) test results, followed by the volatile memory test results. Each figure represents the averaged, smoothed
results across the samples.

Voltage testing

The first five tests were conducted to determine which voltage amplitude produced the most favorable memristive
response. These initial trials revealed that a 1 Vpp signal yielded the most consistent and measurable results. As outlined
in the Methods section, the first four of these tests were performed using a square wave input.

Frequency testing

After identifying 1 Vpp as the optimal input voltage during the initial square wave tests (Tests 1–4), the waveform was
switched to a sine wave for further analysis (Tests 5–10). The aim of this phase was to identify the frequency at which
memristive behavior––specifically a pinched hysteresis loop––became apparent.

In Tests 1–5, the voltage amplitude was optimized using square waves. Between Tests 5 and 6, the waveform was
changed from square to sine. From Tests 6–10, frequency sweeps were carried out with sine waves to identify memristive
crossing. In Test 11, the voltage range was expanded at 10 Hz (5 Vpp) to enhance the response. This revealed behavior
close to that of an ideal memristor. Notably, Test 1 had already shown consistent linear behavior, indicating resistive char-
acteristics. The results are shown in Figs 5–13. Fig 14 details a sample noise profile, and Fig 15 summarizes memristive
accuracy.

Figs 5–10 show the output of Tests 2–7. The frequency was gradually reduced until a crossing near the origin was first

observed, as shown in Fig 10. To ensure this result was not an outlier caused by overshooting the ideal frequency, the
test was repeated at a slightly higher frequency (50 Hz, Test 8, shown in Fig 11). This confirmed that the optimal response
occurred below 25 Hz.

As summarized in Table 2, the frequency was decreased to 10 Hz (Test 9, shown in Fig 12), which produced a clear

crossing in the I–V curve near the −0.4 V region. To enhance the visibility of this behavior, the voltage was increased to 5 Vpp,
which resulted in a more pronounced memristive signature (Test 10). Fig 13 illustrates this result, displaying a nearly ideal
pinched hysteresis loop indicative of memristor functionality. The highest accuracy, at 95%, was at a 10 Hz sine wave at 1 V.
Fig 14 details the noise from an individual sample. Fig 15 details the average memristive accuracy of each configuration.

Volatile memory experiment

For the volatile memory tests 1 and 2, single read and write operations were performed across the memristor voltage
divider. For volatile memory test 3, continuous read and write operations were performed across the memristor voltage
divider while the frequency was gradually increased. The primary results are summarized in Table 3. The results are dis-
played in Figs 16–20. Averaged nemristive accuracy is displayed in Fig 21.

Discussion

Overview

Using low-cost materials, shiitake mushrooms were cultured into ideal memristors. Ideal and non-ideal memristive prop-
erties have been observed previously in fungi, but these required far more complex interfacing methods [26]. Although

several techniques have been proposed to preserve fungal samples, we obtained experimental validation that dehydration
can preserve the observed properties in a previously “programmed” sample [27]. Ideal memristor properties are observed
at lower frequencies, but potential latencies can be offset through massive parallelization, as in nature [26,28,29]. As
known from previous works on fungal memristors, the mycelial structure contains capacitive, memfractive, and memristive
proteins [25,26]. In the memristive tests, accuracy decreased as the frequency increased. The observed rapid switch-
ing speed of 5,850 Hz, an accuracy of 90% (± 1%) low energy consumption relative to prior conventional systems, light
weight, and radiation resistance all make fungal memristors attractive for edge computing, aerospace, and embedded
firmware applications [25–27]. Unlike expensive conventional memristors, culturing fungal memristors does not require
large facilities or rare minerals. The process can be scaled to grow large systems, which can be programmed and pre-
served for long-term use at low cost.

Limitations

Our study was limited by the relatively short timescale of less than two months. Other researchers have documented
memristive properties in mycelial materials, but their studies also focused on short-term performance [26]. Another lim-
itation was that only single, relatively bulky samples were prepared. To truly compete with conventional devices at the
microscale and below, memristors will need to be far smaller [7,8,11]. Even in the same growth medium, each sample pro-
duced a vastly different culture, and the outcomes have yet to be fully characterized by electrical properties. However, the
development of these devices is in an early stage, and they could eventually be miniaturized, especially using improved
cultivation techniques. Complications associated with the growth media were not explored, although previous research
has found that fungi are quite robust to varying conditions [26].

Future work

Although fungal memristors can be produced at low cost, certain aspects of the process could be further optimized. First,
consistent cultivation techniques could be improved using three-dimensional (3D)-printed templates and structures that
shape the shiitake mushroom into the desired geometry. Second, programming could be facilitated by adding electrical
contacts into a 3D-printed cultivation structure. Finally, long-term use would necessitate preservation, which could involve
a variety of techniques, including dehydration, desiccation, freeze-drying, certain hydrogels, and special coatings [27]. By
testing devices produced to physical stress conditions, a combination of these techniques could enable the development
of fast, radiation-resistant, and low-energy memristors grown from low-cost organic materials. The future of computing
could be fungal.

Conclusions

Currently, the fabrication of semiconductor memristors requires rare-earth minerals and large facilities, and culturing
delicate neural organoids requires a complex chemical environment to be maintained in a bioreactor. Fungal computing

may provide a robust and accessible alternative. Fungal systems have lower power requirements, lighter weights, faster
switching speeds, and lower industrial overheads than conventional devices. In this study, fungal memristors were fabri-
cated, programmed, and tested using shiitake mushrooms and conventional electronics. Dehydration-based preservation
was successfully explored, demonstrating the robustness of our devices. When used as RAM, our mushroom memristor

was able to operate at up to 5,850 Hz at an accuracy of 90 ± 1%. In addition, shiitake mushrooms are biodegradable and
have demonstrated radiation resistance, suggesting that the potential applications of fungal computing range from sus-
tainable computing devices to aerospace technologies.
